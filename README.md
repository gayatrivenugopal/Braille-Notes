braille-mail
============

The application is intended to help the visually impaired to type an email in Grade 1 Braille. The email is sent using the default email account configured on the device.
The screen is considered to be a cell of six dots. You can type using the vibrations on the device that are activated when you touch a dot.
The tutorial will guide you in understanding the various patterns of dots for each character.
Initially, a sighted person will be required to train the user to press the send button once the mail has been typed in Braille. After a few trials, the user can easily send mails without any help.
The voice assistant will guide you through the entire process. If you need privacy, you have the option of turning it off.
You will need an Internet connection in order to install the text to speech service if it is not installed on your device already, and to send the mail successfully.
