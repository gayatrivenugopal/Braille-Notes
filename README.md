braille-notes
============

The application is intended to help the visually impaired to type a note in Grade 1 Braille. The screen is considered to be a cell of six dots. You can type using the vibrations on the device that are activated when you touch a dot.
The tutorial will guide you in understanding the various patterns of dots for each character. The voice assistant will guide you through the entire process. If you need privacy, you have the option of turning it off.
You will need an Internet connection in order to install the text to speech service if it is not installed on your device already.
